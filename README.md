# Student-Gradebook
This is a student gradebook using python code, you are able to enter students grades, view the gradebook, and view a students average grade

You use it by pressing the number 1 to enter a students name, it will then ask you how many grades you want to enter in

choose a number between 1-4 of grades you want to enter in, once you do this you will be able to enter in whatever grades you want

you can also view the student gradebook by pressing the number 2

and for the third option, it allows you to see a students grade average

I used this youtube tutorial (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vk44nFfEeVM) to give me a rough idea of what to do and some things I could add to it

I also used the ai helper to help me fix any issues I had with the program and to give me other things to add to the code
